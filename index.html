				<h2> it's so hard to say goodbye to yesterday </h2>
				<h4> Boys Ii Men </h2> 
				How do I say goodbye to what we had?
				The good times that made us laugh
				Outweigh them bad I thought we'd get to see forever
But forever's gone away
It's so hard to say goodbye to yesterday

I don't know where this road is going to lead
All I know is where we've been
And what we've been through

If we get to see tomorrow
I hope it's worth all the wait
It's so hard to say goodbye to yesterday

And I'll take with me the memories
To be my sunshine after the rain
It's so hard to say goodbye to yesterday

And I'll take with me the memories
To be my sunshine after the rain
It's so hard to say goodbye to yesterday
